	 * After substitution, remaining quotations might be useless or

	 * RewriteLink from hiding supposedly hidden variables, consume
	 * them.
	 *
	 * Specifically this code makes 3 assumptions
	 *
	 * 1. LocalQuotes in front root level And, Or or Not links on the
	 *    pattern body are not consumed because they are supposedly
	 *    used to avoid interpreting them as pattern matcher
	 *    connectors.
	 *
	 * 2. Quote/Unquote are used to wrap scope links so that their
	 *    variable declaration can pattern match grounded or partially
	 *    grounded scope links.
	 *
	 * 3. Quote/Unquote are also used to wrap Evaluation containing
	 *    GroundedPredicate and possibly other atom types with special
	 *    handling by the pattern matcher.
	 *
	 * No other use of quotation is assumed besides the 3 above.
	 *
	 * Examples:
	 *
	 * 1. Remove UnquoteLink wrapping around a closed term. Assuming
	 * the current link is
	 *
	 * Get
	 *   Variable "$X"
	 *   Quote
	 *     Evaluation
	 *       Unquote GroundedSchema "scm: dummy"
	 *       Unquote Variable "$X"
	 *
	 * then applying this function returns
	 *
	 * Get
	 *   Variable "$X"
	 *   Quote
	 *     Evaluation
	 *       GroundedSchema "scm: dummy"
	 *       Unquote Variable "$X"
